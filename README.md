# dsprojects.github.io

This is the repository associated to my [GitHub pages](https://alessiot.github.io/dsprojects/). Some notes on how I created these pages follow. 

1. Create a GitHub repository, make it public

2. Clone it 

3. Download a style from the freely available html5 styles (here)[https://html5up.net/]

4. Unzip and move unzipped content to the cloned repo

5. Free photos are available at (Unsplash)[https://unsplash.com/]

6. Commit code

7. Under settings of your repo, go to Pages and select source and branch for deploying your page
